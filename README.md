# RAG Across GitHub issues with Hono + Neon + Drizzle

- Uses openai embeddings
- Had to turn on `node_compat` in `wrangler.toml` in order to support pgvector
- Had to manually modify Drizzle migration generated by `pgvector/drizzle-orm`, since it wrote `"vector(...)"` in quotes in the table definition, which throws an error in postgres! It must be unquoted

## Dev Commands

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

```
npm run deploy
```

```
npm run db:generate
npm run db:migrate

npm run embeddings:generate
```

## Configuring Neon

Install the neon CLI and follow this script (you'll need the `jq` command line utility). Alternatively, grab your connection string from the Neon dashboard and add it to a `.dev.vars` file in the root of the project under the key `DATABASE_URL`.

```sh
# Authenticate with neon cli
neonctl auth

# Create project if you haven't already
#
# > *skip this* if you already created a project,
# > and grab the DATABASE_URL from your dashboard
PROJECT_NAME=community-in-pocket
neonctl projects create --name $PROJECT_NAME --set-context

# Set project id because the call to `set-context` below needs it
PROJECT_ID=$(neonctl projects list --output=json | jq --arg name "$PROJECT_NAME" '.projects[] | select(.name == $name) | .id')

# Create a `dev` db branch then set context
BRANCH_NAME=dev
neonctl branches create --name=$BRANCH_NAME
neonctl set-context --project-id=$PROJECT_ID --branch=$BRANCH_NAME

# Finally, add connection string to .dev.vars
DATABASE_URL=$(neonctl connection-string)
echo -e '\nDATABASE_URL='$DATABASE_URL'\n' >> .dev.vars
```
